Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iterating through an array of elements one at a time and inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted sub-array to the left of it.

The algorithm works as follows:

Start with the second element in the array.
Compare the second element with the first element. If the second element is smaller, swap them.
Move to the third element and compare it with the second element. If the third element is smaller than the second, swap them. 
Then compare the second element with the first element, and swap them if needed.
Repeat this process for each element in the array, comparing each element with the ones to its left and swapping as needed to keep the left sub-array sorted.
