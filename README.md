### Getting Started

1. Clone repository
2. Make sure you have node installed
3. Run `npm install`


### Commands
Run all tests: `npm run test`
Run specific file of tests: `npm run test Deck_Of_Cards` or whatever file you want to run
    - You will want to do this most of the time, otherwise the tests for the other prompts will be failing

### Instructions
Each folder contains the test cases for a particular coding prompt I would like you to practice implementing. Each test file contains tests describing the desired functionality. Your job is to make the tests pass by implementing what is described. If you feel so inclined to write more tests, please do so. Some prompts specify certain ways to write things - such as using a do-while or for each loop.

You can probably easily find solutions to these by googling, but you will get the most value out of this exercise by only searching for things like syntax, and exercising your own logic and reasoning for solving the problems.


Coding Prompts are not in any particular order, but the approximate difficulty for Typescript and Fundamental Programming Skills is:
Easy
-------
Sum_Array
Find_Largest_Element
Find_Longest_String
Simple_Palindrome
Create_Largest_Number
Roll_Die
Search_Array
Multidimensional_Largest_Element
Multidimensional_Transpose
Bubble_Sort
Insertion_Sort
--------------
Hard
